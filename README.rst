The tool relieves you from all the tedious calculations of a multi-stage
geocache. It converts a https://www.geocaching.com geocache description into a
Google Docs sheet where you can enter the answers to the questions. The sheet
then performs all intermediate and final coordinate calculations for you.


Description
===========

CAche Sheet PReparation supports the preparation of Google Docs sheets for
multi-stage geocaches. The sheet can be opened offline (!) on a mobile device
if the offline mode of the document is active and if you open it in Google's
Chrome browser.

The sheet provides fields to enter the answers to the questions of each stage,
and automatically calculates intermediate and the final geocache positions
depending on the values you enter. Hopefully this reduces calculation errors to
a minimum, so that you can enjoy a hassle-free geocaching tour.


Limitations
===========

Only geocaches of https://www.geocaching.com and only Google Docs sheets are
supported.

As the multi-stage descriptions are structured in many different ways, the tool
is not be able to correctly process all possible geocache descriptions. In this
case the tool tries to support you as much as possible.
