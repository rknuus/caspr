The tool relieves you from all the tedious calculations of a multi-stage
geocache. It converts the geocache description into a Google Docs Sheet where
you can enter the answers to the questions. The Sheet then performs all
intermediate and final coordinate calculations for your.


Description
===========

CAche Sheet PReparation supports the preparation of Google Docs sheets for
multi-stage geocaches. The sheet can be opened offline (!) on a mobile device
if the offline mode of the document is active and if you open it in Google's
Chrome browser.

The sheet provides fields to enter the answers to the questions of each stage,
and automatically calculates intermediate and the final geocache positions
depending on the values you enter. Hopefully this reduces calculation errors to
a minimum and let's you focus on enjoying the geocaching tour.

As the multi-stage descriptions are structured in many different ways, the tool
is not be able to correctly process all possible geocache descriptions. In this
case the tool tries to support you as much as possible.
